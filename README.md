## English version

Welcome to the official repository of the [R CHARTS](https://r-charts.com/) site! 


### What is R CHARTS?

R CHARTS is a web site specialized in data visualization in R. The site contains over 1000 charts, 120 tutorials and three color tools for each language, both base R and ggplot2 graphics.


### How and Who

The site was generated with blogdown, an R package for developing HUGO websites in R (allowing using R Markdown). This is a work by JosÃ© Carlos Soage and the development of the first public version took over 6 months of hard work.


### What is in the box?


#### Tutorials
There are 8 main categories. Once you select one you can filter the charts based on the type of chart and the package used to create it (base R or ggplot2).

</p>


Then you can access each tutorial. You can copy and paste each code clicking on the upper right button of the code chunks, navigate through the sections with the left menu and view more related content with the carrousel of the bottom.

</p>


There are also tutorials for learning how to customize the charts, both for base R and ggplot2. The base R section has a mega menu with quick guides and accesible links. There are also two pages that contains all the tutorials for base R and all the tutorials for ggplot2.

Note that there is a live search feature to look for the tutorials. Click on the search button or press SHIFT to open it. You can close it with clicking over the icon or pressing ESC.

#### Color tools

The site contains the full list of colors available in R (the colors() function). You can copy both the HEX or the name of the color. The page also contains a color converter from HEX to RGB (use it with the rgb function) and a color picker.

</p>

There is also a page that contains almost 500 different color palettes from 16 R packages.

</p>

If you want to create you own color palette use the color palette generator (work in progress). You can also upload your own plot in SVG and change its colors for previsualization purposes.

### How to contribute?

If you think there are important charts missing on the site open a pull request and let me know. I have a roadmap and I know there are still many interesting tutorials without their corresponding tutorial, but if you provide feedback I will be able to priorize the most important tutorials. If you want to create the tutorial also open an issue asking me for the steps you will have to follow.

If you have developed a chart that you think it can be interesting to other people or if you have developed a new R package for visualization and you think it open a pull request explaining me about that visualizations. If you want me to create the tutorial for your proposal it might take some time to be available, but if you want to contribute creating the tutorial also open a pull request asking me for the steps to follow.
